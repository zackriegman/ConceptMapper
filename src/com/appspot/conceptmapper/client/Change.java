/*
 * OK, I need to think through what information I need to back out each of
 * deletion, addition, and modification for each of propositions and arguments.
 * 
 * Proposition deletion:  At the moment there is no linking so if a proposition 
 * is deleted it needs to be removed only from its parent argument.  However in the future
 * there will be a more complicated relationship for arguments and propositions.  When
 * that happens a proposition deletion may not make sense at all.  Rather you would
 * only have proposition unlinking.  Maybe a proposition would be deleted if it had
 * no arguments that used it... but maybe that just means it's a top level proposition
 * and should be kept.  It may make sense to implement linking before I implement versioning
 * (or vice-versa) because the design of one might have a big impact on the design of the other.
 * Maybe instead of proposition deletion, there should be proposition spam marking to mark
 * those propositions that should not be returned in searches because they are spam/vandalism.
 * Linking/unlinking of propositions to arguments would be handled by an argument modification
 * change.  But how does this work with the current editing scheme, where, when a proposition is
 * deleted by editing it's content.  How would a system of linking and unlinking deal with minor changes?
 * 
 * Proposition addition:  This seems simple to version. Simply delete the proposition to go backwards
 * in time.  Don't have to worry about updating the arguments that held the proposition, because those
 * changes would be held in separate argument change objects.  By the time you've gone backwards in time
 * enough to delete a proposition there should be no arguments that refer to it anymore.
 * 
 * Proposition modifications:  I think these should be easy, all you've got to do
 * is record what the proposition looked like before the modification.
 * 
 * Argument addition: 
 * 
 * Argument deletion:
 * 
 * Argument modification:
