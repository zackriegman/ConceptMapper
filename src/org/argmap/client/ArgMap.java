/* TODO: ModeVersions: for some reason child nodes of a deleted and re-added link are not showing up in the first attachement of the node

/*TODO: what happens in ModeVersions if I first link to a node as negated, then delete it, then link to it as non-negated and delete that
 * (or vice-versa)?  Nodes are stores by ID in the deletedNodes list. Since its stored in a hashmap, storing the same deleted node twice will
 * result in only one copy.  Will that work for storing the history?  One thing I want to work out below is only storing the history for a
 * link that is relevant to the time that it exists in the tree so there aren't a lot of extra changes in the change list.  Will having
 * only one copy complicate that?  If so maybe I could save in a list or a hashmap keyed on date instead of ID (or ID and date, or something)...
 * 
 * Regardless, as far as negation is concerned, if there is only one copy, I can't depend on it to have the right negated value when
 * it is re-added to the tree for the first time.

/*TODO: a proposition tree begins at time A.  At time C a pre-existing node is linked into the proposition tree.
 * The user browses to a time B between times A and C.  At that time the linked node is not present.
 * However the linked node is open in the tree(as a deleted node, so its changes are displayed in the change list).
 * The result is that there are changes that the user can scroll past that have no apparent effect on the tree
 * very confusing... so only a the changes post dating the linked nodes linking should be added to the change list?
 */
/*TODO: versions mode: update link coloring depending on whether a proposition is currently a link?
 * to do this properly it seems like for each proposition, I need to included in the changes sent to the client
 * unlinks which lower the link count to less than or equal to one, and links which raise the link
 * count above one. (usually link events aren't considered events of the proposition being unlinked, 
 * but rather of the argument link/unlinking to the proposition.)
 * Then on the client those changes would be handled by forwards/backwards function.  Maybe the function
 * would notice whether the ViewNode associated with the change was an argument or a proposition.  If it was a 
 * proposition it would update the props link status.  If it was an argument it would just do what it currently does.
 * This way the system would work for propositions whose link coloring is changed by a linking/unlinking not within
 * the tree being viewed by the user...

/*TODO: ModeVersions:  undoing unlinks does not restore the link's yellow color if the link *currently* is not  
 * linked to by more than one argument because the server sends the current proposition which
 * indicates a link count of 1.  This could be addressed by having a proposition's link/unlink
 * events also be owned by that proposition in VersionsMode, and hiding them probably (because
 * they may be interesting only in regards to the color of the node because the unlink/link
 * events may be with regards to arguments that are not currently opened) and treating
 * them as only coloring events when moving forwards and backwards (thus in some cases there
 * would be two link/unlink ViewChanges, one for the proposition whose link count is being updated
 * and one for the argument which needs to either display or hide the linked proposition).  The forwards/backwards
 * methods could distinguish between links/unlinks that were to be treated only as coloring events versus
 * ones that would be treated as displaying/removing the linked proposition based on whether the ViewNodeVer
 * object contained in the ViewChange object was a ViewPropVer or a ViewArgVer.  If it's a ViewArgVer
 * it would display/remove the linked proposition.  If it's a ViewPropVer it would simply update the link
 * count and change the color from yellow to white if it falls below 2, and vice versa.  This would require a
 * change on the server to return the coloring events for a proposition, and would require changes on the client
 * to insert the coloring events into the timeMachineMap and so forth.

/*TODO: move changes from propID/argID to parentID/childID (this will make querying more efficient:  want
 * all the changes having to do with a particular node?  Just query on parentID with that node's ID.
 * Hmmm... what about prop adds where the proposition has content?  Anyway, the idea being, that when
 * a node is updated we store its id in the parentID.  So when we query on parentID we get all the additions to,
 * deletions from, and content modifications of, the node and nothing else.  Right now querying on propID
 * gives not only additions to, deletions from, and content modifications of, the prop, it also gives additions of,
 * links of, and deletions of the prop, which in my current paradigm for handling changes, I don't need.
