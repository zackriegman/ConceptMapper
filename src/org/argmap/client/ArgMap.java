//TODO: read more about: http://domino.research.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/0/66fb7b9f526da69c852570fa00753e93?OpenDocument
//TODO: continue research on "collaborative reasoning" and other possible similar projects (argument mapping)

//TODO: versionsmode display only opened top level nodes.
//TODO: batch open icon not visible/clickable on props that reach right screen edge
//TODO: searched for "use this" even when proposition has children, and throws an error if you click on "use this"
//TODO: test in chrome, safari, ie8, opera,

//TODO: figure out CSS inheritance
//TODO: prevent circular linking from crashing program...
//TODO: fix linking of root level nodes automatically incorporating the node into another tree...(and therefore not color the node appropriately)
//TODO: provide a way to see deleted top level nodes

//TODO: implement user accounts, email updates of changes, inviting friends
//TODO: implement proposition strength voting, and scoring algorithm
//TODO: poll server every few seconds for server side changes (this has to come after versioning I think)
//TODO: add helpful message along the side (tips box)

/*TODO: if you close a node in versions mode sometimes you can never open it again (in that versions
 * session) because it will 
 * never have children again given the dates available to click on.  For instance if you add a node, 
 * add a child, delete the child, and delete the node, all consecutively, and then go to a time when 
 * the node has children and close it, the node will never have children again because it doesn't have
 * children when it is created or when it is destroyed... and there are no visible events in between...
 * this should be a low priority fix, but it might take some ui creativity... ui creativity should be minimal
 * just add a placeholder element like "-----" for instance... but need to think about how to detect when
 * this is necessary and what date to assign the placeholder...
 */
/*TODO: undoing unlinks does not restore the link's yellow color if the link *currently* is not  
 * linked to by more than one argument because the server sends the current proposition which
 * indicates a link count of 1.  This could be addressed by having a proposition's link/unlink
 * events also be owned by that proposition in VersionsMode, and hiding them probably (because
 * they may be interesting only in regards to the color of the node because the unlink/link
 * events may be with regards to arguments that are not currently opened) and treating
 * them as only coloring events when moving forwards and backwards (thus in some cases there
 * would be two link/unlink ViewChanges, one for the proposition whose link count is being updated
 * and one for the argument which needs to either display or hide the linked proposition).  The forwards/backwards
 * methods could distinguish between links/unlinks that were to be treated only as coloring events versus
 * ones that would be treated as displaying/removing the linked proposition based on whether the ViewNodeVer
 * object contained in the ViewChange object was a ViewPropVer or a ViewArgVer.  If it's a ViewArgVer
 * it would display/remove the linked proposition.  If it's a ViewPropVer it would simply update the link
 * count and change the color from yellow to white if it falls below 2, and vice versa.  This would require a
 * change on the server to return the coloring events for a proposition, and would require changes on the client
 * to insert the coloring events into the timeMachineMap and so forth.
 */
/*TODO: version mode should only display toplevel propositions that have been interacted with.
 * Displaying open top level propositions is not enough because a toplevel node might
 * have had child nodes that have been deleted and we want to be able to walk through that history.
 * Furthermore, we want to be able to see the modifications of the node.  This isn't exactly ideal.
 * The search feature should return all nodes... not just linked nodes.  What if the node has no
 * children.  How does the user indicated that he wants to view it (since it won't have an
 * open tree icon).  He could click inside it and make it dirty, but that is not intuitive to the
 * user.  This relates to the general question of how to conceive of toplevelness of a node.
 * Rather than toplevelness a node should be tagged with a category, and we would have tagged
 * and untagged nodes.  Tagged ones would show up when browsing, and might have priority when
 * searching, but would otherwise be the same. Hmmm... I don't think this is high priority
 * right now.  Showing open toplevel propositions will get the job done for the time being...
 * [Also note that attempting to version a single empty proposition results in a null pointer
 * exception... so if I decide not to prevent that in the UI (for instance if I decide not to only display
 * toplevel propositions in version mode) then this needs to be fixed.]
 */
//TODO: linking: original linked item should also change color immediately upon first linking
//TODO: linking: how will client automatically update link changes...

/*TODO: implement locking when modifying a parent and deleting/adding nodes to make sure that two simultaneous
 * changes (modifying the parent or deleteing/adding two different child nodes) do not clobber each other
 * and result in inconsistent datastore state. */
//TODO: highlight last change node after time travel
//TODO: think about merging of duplicate propositions (both possibly already having arguments)
//TODO: fine tune UI for arguments... see implementation notes
//TODO: what is this?:   get rid of irrelevant update operations (e.g. clearing update before delete)
//TODO: still an issue?: what are all the phantom propositions that show up on an empty search?
//TODO: decide how to get rid of repetative code (for propositions and args), maybe make them both subclasses of a Node class?
//TODO: if the message queue gets backed up (more than 5?) give user a message that there is trouble saving changes to server, and changes may be lost
//TODO: maintain order of propositions? waiting to see if order gets screwed up
//TODO: IE problems: (1) VersionsMode doesn't seem to work (2) can delete root level proposition without first deleting its text

// TO DO: test in IE, chrome, safari, opera, etc.
// TO DO: upload to appengine, and add an example argument (for instance my argument about legalizing unauthorized access)
// TO DO: implement some basic database integrity checks (e.g. every argument belongs to an existing proposition...)
// TO DO: give people a way to specify logical structure (first order predicate calculus structure of each proposition
// TO DO: add definitions (as a special kind of proposition?)
// TO DO: integrate logic engine to verify validity of arguments
