	/*
	 * This class contains the widget and logic for a program mode that allows
	 * the user to browse versions of an argument tree at different points in
	 * time based on history stored in the form of Change objects which are
	 * generated and stored on the server after every change.
	 * 
	 * The user is presented with a change list on the left, and a tree on the
	 * right that corresponds to the state of the tree at the date selected in
	 * change list.
	 * 
	 * As users open and close ViewNodes in the tree, the change lists is
	 * updated to only show changes relevant to opened nodes, or nodes that
	 * would be opened if they had not been deleted at the point in time
	 * currently selected.
	 * 
	 * When the user selects a new change from the change list the program
	 * applies the intermediate changes to the tree to move the tree either
	 * forwards or backwards in time till it is the same as it was at the time
	 * that the user selected.
	 * 
	 * In order to do this the program keeps a list of all the relevant changes,
	 * in the timeMachineMap field, ordered by the date of the change. Each date
	 * corresponds to a single change, but may correspond to multiple ViewNodes
	 * because the same Node can exist in multiple points in a tree if the Node
	 * has been linked to by different Arguments within a tree. Thus the
	 * timeMachineMap is a SortedMultiMap, sorted and keyed by the date of each
	 * change, with a list of ViewNodes that represent the Node changed by the
	 * Change object.
	 * 
	 * The timeMachineMap contains changes only of nodes that are currently
	 * visible or those that would be visible, except that they have been
	 * deleted or have yet to be added at the current point in time. When the
	 * user closes or opens a node the timeMachineMap is updated.
	 * 
	 * When a user closes a ViewNode all the changes for all the descendants of
	 * that ViewNode are removed from the timeMachineMap. The add/remove changes
	 * for the closed ViewNode are NOT removed from the map however but are
	 * instead marked as 'hidden' (and the textual modifications of the close
	 * ViewNode are left in the map and left un-hidden). Such changes are either
	 * hidden from the user or displayed as dashed lines, whereas the un-hidden
	 * changes have their dates displayed for the user. Hidden changes are kept
	 * in the change list so that as the program moves the tree either forwards
	 * or backwards in time, closed nodes can have their children added/removed
	 * and their open/close icons can be updated to reflect whether they have
	 * children at that point in time or not. In general it is not necessary to
	 * show hidden changes to the user at all, they are processed by the program
	 * silently, and the open/close icon is updated as the user traverses the
	 * tree. However, in some cases, the open/close icon would never be visible
	 * because there are no intervening changes between the time when all of a
	 * Node's children are added and then deleted. In those cases, the hidden
	 * change must be displayed to the user so that the user has a way to select
	 * a moment in time when the Node had children, so that the user can open
	 * the node and browse the children. In those cases, a hidden ViewChange is
	 * displayed in the change list as a dashed line.
	 * 
	 * When a user opens a ViewNode all the changes for all the descendants that
	 * are themselves open are added to the timeMachineMap, and the ViewNode's
	 * changes are marked as un-hidden.
	 * 
	 * That is the general idea. To make all that work, each node keeps track
	 * not only of its current children but also of children that have yet to be
	 * added or that have been deleted at the current time. This allows the
	 * program to collect changes not only from existing nodes but also from
	 * non-existing nodes. This is important because we want to show the changes
	 * for non-existing nodes that are open. For instance, we want to show the
	 * change in the change list that corresponds to adding a node, as well as
	 * the change that corresponds to editing its text. But if the node's parent
	 * is close, we do not want to show those changes, because then when the
	 * user clicks on the change, he/she will see no apparent effect which will
	 * be confusing.
