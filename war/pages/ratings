<h1>Ratings</h1>

<h2>How ratings are used</h2>

<p/>Arguments are presented in the order of
a score that is generated by the system.  The score is intended to be a rough estimate of the strength
of an argument as far as it has been articulated within the system to date.  The system determines
a score based in part on the logical strength of an argument (does it contradict itself, is it circular,
etc.) and in part based on the user generated ratings of propositions.  The stronger the arguments
for or against a proposition, the less the user ratings are taken into account when scoring that 
proposition.  This approach allows the system to generate scores, while emphasizing reasoning over
pre-judgment.

<h2>Why users must be signed in in order to rate</h2>

<p/>Users must sign in before rating to ensure fairness in the rating system and to prevent abuses
that would undermine the usefulness of the ratings.  The scoring algorithm uses a weighted average
of user ratings as one component of a computed score.  The more productive (i.e. non-reverted) contributions a user has made, the more
his or her ratings are weighted.  <p/>This approach eliminates 
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry">sock puppetry</a> problems
in the rating system.  The more accounts a user makes the less the votes from each account are weighted
in the average rating that the scoring algorithm uses.  Individual users only have as much voting weight
as their productive reasoning contributions entitle them.  If they divide those productive
contributions among multiple accounts the weight of their ratings are similarly divided.  
This approach also eliminates automated (bot based)
sock puppetry, because a bot account will first need to generate productive reasoning contributions (something
that bots are currently unable to do) before its votes will be factored into the weigthed average.
(Note that if a user account is responsible for spamming or vandalism or excessive number of reverted
changes, the account will be suspended, and ratings from that account will not be factored in to the
weighted average at all.)
