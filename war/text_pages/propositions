<h1>Editing Propositions</h1>
<p/>When editing proposition the intent should always be to improve the clarity and strength of the 
argument.  If you think the argument is weak, you can express that through counter arguments, but 
not by making the expression of the argument weaker.  The goal is to keep refining an argument until 
it is the strongest expression of that line of reasoning.  Then, if you disagree with that line of 
reasoning, you are offering counter arguments to the strongest argument.  It is more effective to 
prove the strongest argument wrong than to prove staw man positions wrong.
