<h1>Editing Links</h1>
<p/>Before editing propositions that have been linked to by other arguments you must click the edit
button.  Doing so insures that you are aware of the importance of maintaining the meaning of linked
propositions while editing them.  

<p/>The meaning of a linked proposition should never be changed because if the meaning is changed
   to conform to one argument, it may no longer make sense in the other arguments where the proposition is used.  
   If an argument evolves so that a proposition with a different meaning is needed in place of a linked proposition, 
   rather than change the meaning of the linked proposition, the linked propositions should be unlinked
   and a new proposition with a different meaning should be created.  Editing linked propositions should only be done to improve the wording and 
   clarity for the current meaning of the proposition.
