<h1>Editing Links</h1>
<p/>
When editing linked propositions it is important to keep in mind that the proposition is used elsewhere.
  For that reason the meaning of the proposition should never be changed, because if the meaning is changed
   to conform to one argument, it may no longer make sense in the other arguments where the proposition is used.  
   If an argument evolves so that a proposition with a different meaning is needed in place of a linked proposition, 
   rather than change meaning, the proposition should be unlinked, and a new proposition with a different 
   meaning should be created.  Editing linked propositions should only be done to improve the wording and 
   clarity for the current meaning of the proposition.
