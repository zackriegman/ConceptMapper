<h1>Editing Arguments</h1>
<p/>An argument's text should only be a simple title.  The substance of an argument should be expressed
 in its propositions, not in its title.  The title is intended only to give users a convenient way to 
 distinguish between different arguments when the parent proposition has many child arguments.  Thus, 
 for proposition with only one or two arguments, typically arguments will not need a title.
