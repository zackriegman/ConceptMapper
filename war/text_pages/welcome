<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p/>Welcome to coreason.org. This site is an opensource effort to reason together as a global community about the most important
 issues facing humanity today
 (and any other issues while we're at it).

<P/>All of the content on this site is open source, and everybody is free to take it 
and use it however they would like
(provided that they pass the same rights on to other users).
The goal of the site is to create a public resource that will help people understand critical and complex issues, and to develop a
 method of collaborative reasoning that will help our democracies move towards new levels of productivity and effectiveness.

<p/>Please jump right in and start participating.  You can find issues of interest to you by searching in the panel to the left. 
 Explore chains of reasoning by
opening them in that panel.  If you have an idea about how to improve a chain of reasoning you can edit it right there.  Or start a new one by entering a claim in the search
bar and clicking "Add as new proposition."  As you edit, check back here for helpful tips about how to make your participation as productive and helpful as
 possible.  Most of all don't hesitate to start contributing!  Other users will help revise and improve your contributions while you are learning the ropes.
